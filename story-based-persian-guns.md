A story based, tell-tale-like game based in a world where technology progressed along the lines of the old Persian law that even the king could not revoke a law he had passed once it was sealed with his seal. In particular weaponry was made irrevocable such that guns, for example, once loaded, were locked so that they could not be unloaded, were tethered electronically to the one who loaded them, and would kill that person painfully over the course of 24 hours if the weapon was not discharged into a living target during that time.
