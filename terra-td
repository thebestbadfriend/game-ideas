terraforming factory td-like game where instead of enemies, it is environmental factors like balance of gasses in the atmosphere, amount of atmosphere, gravity, plant life, herbivores, predators, weather, meteor showers, etc that must be dealt with.

probably no so much tower "defense" but use of buildings and drones to manipulate the environment
