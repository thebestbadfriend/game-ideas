Think if slay the spire was a tower defense game

I like how you get cards (such as by beating enemies/bosses, buying in shops, random events, etc) in slay the spire
I like the map and navigation of slay the spire
I like the class structure of slay the spire
I like the relic system of slay the spire
I like the way "energy" works in slay the spire
I like the way bosses and minibosses work in slay the spire
I like the way upgrading cards works in slay the spire
I like the way remaining health and resources carry across levels, but health is refilled between chapters in slay the spire

I like how monkey city levels are won by beating a certain number of waves. Could be that each wave is one turn. You draw your cards and play them on your turn based on the amount of energy or money or whatever you have and the mobs "turn" is the wave itself during which, it's... y'know... their turn... not yours.

For now I am thinking no overworld city thing (like what HoH, Monkey City, and other games have). I am thinking more a jump right into it, every playthrough is its own whole thing but unlock new cards, encounters, bosses, etc by playing kind of thing like what slay the spire is, except that where it is only by gaining experience that you only unlock new cards, maybe a "for the king" approach to it so that leveling up each class unlocks new cards for that class, but doing certain things also unlocks bosses, events, etc so that - for example, a certain boss might only unlock after you kill 50 of a certain kind of enemy or a ceratin playable class might unlock after you kill a miniboss without taking any damage or in less than a certain number of turns
