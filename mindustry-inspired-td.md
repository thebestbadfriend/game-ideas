**you don't have to know everything in order to build a game.
Just start building it, and figure it out as you go if needed.
You can still do lessons and so on but don't let it get in the
way of getting started actually building the game. Better to
have somthing built than nothing. Like the saying says, you can
edit a bad story but not a blank page.**

## Summary

## Resources

- iron
- gold
- oil

## Tech advancement

I like some things about the mindustry tech tree, but I feel like this is one of the most important things in a game to make stand out

Maybe something like this
- a kind of dark souls inspired progression system where each tower gains [whatever you might want to call experience] by killing enemies and that experience can be spent on upgrades for that individual tower.
  - could make upgrades cost a combination of experience and resources or make it them cost resources but lower the resource cost if experience is used and, if enough experience is used, eliminate the resource cost. This would encourange strategizing about whether to pay resources for upgrades early or to play the long game and wait to buy upgrades with experience
  - could expand this progression style to other things such as units or other buildings gaining experience by gathering resources/killing enemies/producing power/etc
  - could pair this individual-style progression with a system inspired by monkey knowledge so that most upgrades are done at the individual tower/unit level but some very expensive upgrades that affect all of a category of things (all towers, all attack units, all resource gathering buildings and units, the gameplay itself (such as mana shield in bloons)) can be bought in a centralized tabular menu
  - after reaching a certain "level" overall should a tower/unit become a "hero"
    - imagine hero resource gatherers/power plants. lol (that could actually be a very interesting concept. What would make a power plant a "hero")

## Overworld and levels

mindustry uses a world map of sorts. Do similar but with rise of nations or warhammer 40k elements like a turn based world map with each territory being a "level" you can attack or defend etc?

---
## Factions

Like an oil-focused faction (benefits/drawbacks? pollution?) or a nature-focused faction (benefits/drawbacks? Unable to use oil or heavy penalty related to using oil?)
Factions could be similar to in rise of nations or warhammer 40k too. Maybe throw in something like the shipments feature of AOE3?

---
## Enemies and/or other obstacles

What kinds of enemies?

In terms of other obstacles, maybe in this one or maybe not, but it could be interesting to build a non-combat tower defence and factory game like this where natural obstacles like weather and geographic occurences like volcanoes are the thigns being defended against and/or defeated/circumvented in some way

## Other Notes

Seems a game like this would naturally lend itself well to AOE-style multiplayer skirmishes (cooperative and otherwise)
Don't get hung up on this. Build the game, and then you can work on multiplayer afterwards. Multiplayer is hard to do, and you should get comfortable with building a whole single-player game first. Plenty of games do that. Stardew did that and it was massively successful even before multiplayer was introduced. Slime rancher doesn't officially have multiplayer at all and is also very successful.

Also remember that mindustry is graphically minimalistic but still does well. Do what you do well, and don't worry too much about the rest. It'll come. There are free assets or if you really need to do things like art yourself, pixel art - even very simplistic pixel art - has been used to make very successful games.
