**you don't have to know everything in order to build a game.
Just start building it, and figure it out as you go if needed.
You can still do lessons and so on but don't let it get in the
way of getting started actually building the game. Better to
have somthing built than nothing. Like the saying says, you can
edit a bad story but not a blank page.**

## Summary

factorio meets Warcraft/AOE/Rise-of-Nations/something-like-that meets tower defense (which is the basic concept of mindustry)

## Resources

this is partly a list to remember what resources I'm thinking of including and partly a list to remind me to think about how to enforce the management of "resources". For example, you don't collect time - of course - but if there is nothing pressing on you to manage your time (such as preparing for enemy attacks or beating a countdown etc), then time management naturally doesn't matter that much, and in a game like this, that often seems undesirable.

### Natural resources
- wood
- iron
- gold
- oil

### Capacity management
some resource capacity in main command center, but how to expand it?
- silos like Tiberian Sun?

### Other resources
- time (either as real-time or as turns, but most likely real-time)
- experience in whatever fashion might be considered a resource

## Tech advancement

I like some things about the mindustry tech tree, but I feel like this is one of the most important things in a game to make stand out

Maybe something like this
- a kind of dark souls inspired progression system where each tower gains [whatever you might want to call experience] by killing enemies and that experience can be spent on upgrades for that individual tower.
  - could make upgrades cost a combination of experience and resources or make it them cost resources but lower the resource cost if experience is used and, if enough experience is used, eliminate the resource cost. This would encourange strategizing about whether to pay resources for upgrades early or to play the long game and wait to buy upgrades with experience
  - could expand this progression style to other things such as units or other buildings gaining experience by gathering resources/killing enemies/producing power/etc
  - could pair this individual-style progression with a system inspired by monkey knowledge so that most upgrades are done at the individual tower/unit level but some very expensive upgrades that affect all of a category of things (all towers, all attack units, all resource gathering buildings and units, the gameplay itself (such as mana shield in bloons)) can be bought in a centralized tabular menu
  - after reaching a certain "level" overall should a tower/unit become a "hero"
    - imagine hero resource gatherers/power plants. lol (that could actually be a very interesting concept. What would make a power plant a "hero")
  - I actually think I prefer the idea of having a variety of units that handle the heroism thing.
    - each category of tower/building has a hero builder that builds/upgrades it (think like in that warcraft 3 tower defense minigame)
      - start the game with a basic one who builds regular nodes and some basic towers and buildings
        - this hero's modules (towers/buildings) can generally be built on any kind of node even if it belongs to a different hero
      - able to level up your hq and at each level get to pick one of two or three builder heroes (this way you can't just have access to all the things at once but have to commit to a path at each hq level)
      - each builder hero can build a specialized node type that can handle their buildings
      - maybe at each level of the hq the choice of heroes is something like
        - one that focuses on towers
        - one that focuses on offensive units
        - one that focuses on "manning units" which can be garrisoned in buildings to provide specific effects
          - manning units might include things like
            - units to add an element/other-special-effect to a tower or to improve special effects on a tower that already matches the unit's traits
              - some interesting combinations possible here
                - What about an area effect tower "manned" with a sniper
                - Or a healing tower that heals your units combined with an "increase base damage" unit so that combat units within range of the healing tower also have their base damage increased while they stay within range of that tower

<br>
Another idea that could be a kind of addition to the above is

- upgrading towers and other buildings by manufacturing parts for them at factories in a fashion similar to training units in AOE except that the parts require resources/other parts to be transported to the factory (as should be obvious from the factorio-likeness of this concept) and then the parts themselves have to be transported to the towers (or other buildings?) either manually or by conveyors and such
  - specific parts could provide specific bonuses or even fundamentally change how certain buildings work
  - could even have most or all major buildings (basically everything that is not a logistic tool) be built on top of blank nodes that are just platforms for modules to be built on and that have slots for installing modules so that you might have a 1 slot node for cheap that could only hold one module (but most any one module (maybe make some modules take up multiple nodes if they are powerful enough)) and go up to a 4 slot node for a higher price but that could be - in one building - 4 turrets or one very powerful turret with upgrades for it installed in the other three slots, or 3 turrets and an on-board power generator so that the tower does not require as much (or maybe any) power from other sources, or something else. This could be a pretty cool concept and adds slot-management as a consideration during gameplay. If you do this, then do you want upgrades to apply at the node level or at the module level or some combination such that nodes can be upgraded in ways that improve their overall function while modules have specific tech trees relating to their specialized purposes? Same question for specialized parts. Do you want specialized parts only for nodes, only for modules, or for both, or if you do this then do you want specialized parts at all? Do the modules not already kind of serve that purpose? Maybe instead of specialized parts, you could have advanced manufactured ammunitions, lubricants, and such that can be supplied to buildings similarly to how it works in mindustry (it's not plagiarism to have that be pretty similar, that's how supply lines tend to work in games like this (remember that there is a difference between natural similarities because of the kind of game it is vs plagiarism of unique or specific ideas. Just stay on the right side of that line)). I think I like that idea better actually. Remember to revise this doc and put ideas where they go so that the whole thing does not stay cluttered like this. Don't delete old ideas though. Just put them in a separate category like "things to maybe implement in another game" or something.

## Overworld and territories

mindustry uses a world map of sorts. Do similar but with rise of nations or warhammer 40k elements like a turn based world map with each territory being a "level" you can attack or defend etc?

---
## Factions

Like an oil-focused faction (benefits/drawbacks? pollution (how would this work? some kind of penalty to other things?)?) or a nature-focused faction (benefits/drawbacks? Unable to use oil or heavy penalty related to using oil?)
Factions could be similar to in rise of nations or warhammer 40k too. Maybe throw in something like the shipments feature of AOE3?

---
## Enemies and/or other obstacles

What kinds of enemies?

In terms of other obstacles, maybe in this one or maybe not, but it could be interesting to build a non-combat tower defence and factory game like this where natural obstacles like weather and geographic occurences like volcanoes are the thigns being defended against and/or defeated/circumvented in some way

---
## UI considerations

- resource gathering may or may not be handled like in Rise of Nations, but I do like the "you are getting this many of each resource per second" view that is available in Rise of Nations and think it is worth including something like that

---
## Other Notes

Seems a game like this would naturally lend itself well to AOE-style multiplayer skirmishes (cooperative and otherwise)
Don't get hung up on this. Build the game, and then you can work on multiplayer afterwards. Multiplayer is hard to do, and you should get comfortable with building a whole single-player game first. Plenty of games do that. Stardew did that and it was massively successful even before multiplayer was introduced. Slime rancher doesn't officially have multiplayer at all and is also very successful.

Also remember that mindustry is graphically minimalistic but still does well. Do what you do well, and don't worry too much about the rest. It'll come. There are free assets or if you really need to do things like art yourself, pixel art - even very simplistic pixel art - has been used to make very successful games.

Don't worry about story or setting or anything like that yet. Get the mechanics where you want them and then put whatever skin or story around that you want. This could even turn into several different but similar games with little more than a reskin and minor tweaks to some mechanics (maybe add one or two and take away one or two) in a similar fashion to what it seems was done with warhammer (fantasy) and warhammer 40k (sci-fi).
