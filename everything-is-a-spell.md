Kind of like everything is a cheat code, but instead of manipulating the rules of the game (changing the rule that you can't walk to say that you can) or directly manipulating values (changing how much money you have), you play within the rules of the game but creatively combine activities such that you achieve desired effects (haste and levitation to emulate a long jump?) and everything - even walking - takes mana. I dunno maybe you're a cripple or something, and that's how you "walk" is by using the Forc-- magic. You're not Yoda. You're like... a boring human version of him without a lightsaber and with the ability to talk normally (if you cast the right spell)
