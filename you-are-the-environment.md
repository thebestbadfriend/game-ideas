A game where you do not control the main character, the bad guys, or anything like that, but rather you are the environment.
You are the ground, water, air, critters, plants, etc
You can add, remove, and change parts of the environment for a cost of some currency/points/something
You can cause plants to bloom, animals to behave in certain ways (a breeding system? with genetics and such?) for a cost of (the same or other?) currency/points/something

Individual levels? A global scale overworld? A home base level that you can improve and change to specialize in certain things and create certain tendencies in the world as a whole, unlocking advantages, disadvantages, and so on to everything and everyone in your world - including the environment you control, the costs of things, and some way in which those changes actually influence "main character" and "bad guy" decisions, successes, failures, damage bonuses, resistances, etc.
