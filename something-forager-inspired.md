something inspired by the game forager.

forager/stardew? forager/sims?




What mechanics do I like about it?

The way buying additional islands works

The use of small spaces to provide meaninful opportunities, challenges, puzzles, and resources and to allow the player to progress comfortably without feeling too slow on the one side or too overwhelmed on the other

Cute aesthetic

Amusing characters

Interesting skill system
