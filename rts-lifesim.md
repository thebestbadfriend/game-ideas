RTS life sim

What if stardew valley, kynseed, garden paws, the sims, etc were rts games?

What if AOE or Warcraft 3 were a life sim?

What if there was a life sim game like stardew valley or the sims or the others that was also an rts game like aoe so that you selected units and buildings and so on and interacted with things as in an rts but the gameplay loop was a life sim gameplay loop (gather resources, improve your home, do little quests for npcs, some story lines, etc)

# Elements To Consider From (mark em with Y or N or something when you've decided)
## Life Sims
### Stardew Valley

### Kynseed

### Garden Paws

### The Sims

## RTS
### AOE3

### Warcraft 3

### Rise of Nations
- Turn Structure

### Command and Conquer
- Building-Specific Tech Progression
  - some buildings require other buildings, and some of these requirements are mutually exclusive to each other so that what buildings are available to you overall differ based on what buildings you have already built, and building some things prevents you from building some other things

## Grand Strategy
### Stellaris
