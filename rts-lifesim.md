RTS life sim

What if stardew valley, kynseed, garden paws, the sims, etc were rts games?

What if AOE were a life sim?

What if there was a life sim game like stardew valley or the sims or the others that was also an rts game like aoe so that you selected units and buildings and so on and interacted with things as in an rts but the gameplay loop was a life sim gameplay loop (gather resources, improve your home, do little quests for npcs, some story lines, etc)
