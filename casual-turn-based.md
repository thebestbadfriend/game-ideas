A game that is not combat heavy (some combat maybe, but not the focus) that is turn based in a way similar to 4x games. Something like Heroes of Might and Magic meets Stardew Valley or The Sims

Move each "hero" or "army" (maybe not those names, but those concepts) so many "tiles" per turn. Engage in encounters similar to HoMM's combat but maybe with shopping, training sims-style skills like handiness (but not handiness)

If it is Sims-like, then maybe bills are due every so many turns, work is every x'th turn or is an option which can be used at the cost of your turn.

Upgrade your house like a base in HoMM.

Buy specialized buildings for your town or attachments to your house (like a chicken coop) which enable some powerful benefits but lock others

For a lot of the 4x-ness, Planar Conquest is a great example. Maybe play a few turns of it to remember what all you like about it and make notes here. Casual or even not so casual games made from a mix of 4x and one or more of The Sims, Warcraft 3, or Dishonored sound like they'd be a lot of fun. Imagine a turn based Dishonored-like (maybe play some of that too, to remember what you like about it) that featured upgradable towns, and hirable units/heroes.

4x stellaris?
